#this document explain how java-win-service works.

= Introduction =

First of all let's understand the purpose of java-win-service. This application was built to solve a common problem: Allow JavaSE programs that run through Command Line Interface, to run as Windows Services.

= Instructions =

To use java-win-service the first thing to do is to install it (http://java-win-service.googlecode.com/files/JavaWinServiceSetup.msi).

The second thing is to enter in c:\javawinservice\ folder and edit the jws.properties file. This file has three important properties:

 # servicename=jettyservice 
 # execbatch=c:/myapp/startJavaProcess.bat 
 # lockfile=c:/myapp/myapp.lock 

 * *servicename*: The name that will be used to log in Event Viewer 
 * *execbatch*: The .bat file that will have the initialization command.
 * *lockfile*: A text file that will be create every time that the java program runs. This file must contains the PID number of java process.
